# SIDI
An Arduino-powered MIDI interface for the Commodore 6581 SID chip.

I've done my best to keep this as clean as possible but some places are still quite a mess. Large swaths of the main sketch are seriously overdo for a complete overhaul and I'll be getting to that as soon as the other parts of my BeagleBoargan project are more stable.

Futher information on this library as well as the project for which it was created can be found [here](http://hatestheinternet.com/kraslophone/midi-sid-arduino/sidi).
